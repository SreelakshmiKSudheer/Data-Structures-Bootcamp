def andXorOr(a):
    """
    Computes the maximum value of the expression (a[i] & a[j]) ^ (a[i] | a[j]) ^ (a[i] ^ a[j])
    for all pairs (i, j) such that i < j in the given list 'a'.
    Args:
        a (List[int]): A list of integers.
    Returns:
        int: The maximum value obtained from the specified expression for all valid pairs.
    Note:
        - The function uses a stack-based approach to efficiently compute the result.
        - The helper function 'find' is assumed to compute the required expression for two integers.
