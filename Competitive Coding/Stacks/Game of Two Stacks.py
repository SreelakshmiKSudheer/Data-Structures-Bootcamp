def twoStacks(maxSum, a, b):
    """
    Determines the maximum number of elements that can be removed from two stacks (represented as lists `a` and `b`)
    without the sum of the removed elements exceeding `maxSum`. Elements can be removed from either stack, but only
    from the top (beginning of the list), and once you switch from one stack to the other, you cannot return.
    Args:
        maxSum (int): The maximum allowed sum of the removed elements.
        a (List[int]): The first stack represented as a list of integers.
        b (List[int]): The second stack represented as a list of integers.
