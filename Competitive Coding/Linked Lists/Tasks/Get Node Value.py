def getNode(llist, positionFromTail):
    """
    Returns the data value of the node at a specified position from the tail of a singly linked list.
    This function uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the node that is 'positionFromTail'
    nodes away from the end of the list.
    Args:
        llist (SinglyLinkedListNode): The head node of the singly linked list.
        positionFromTail (int): The position from the tail (0-based index) of the node whose value is to be retrieved.
    Returns:
        Any: The data value stored in the node at the specified position from the tail.
    Raises:
        AttributeError: If the linked list is shorter than 'positionFromTail' nodes.
