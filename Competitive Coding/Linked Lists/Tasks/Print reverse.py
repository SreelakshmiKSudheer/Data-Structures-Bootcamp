def reversePrint(llist):
    """
    Prints the elements of a singly linked list in reverse order.

    This function traverses the given linked list, collects the data from each node,
    and prints the elements in reverse order (from tail to head), each on a new line.

    Args:
        llist: The head node of a singly linked list. Each node is expected to have
               a 'data' attribute for its value and a 'next' attribute pointing to the next node.

    Returns:
        None. The function prints the elements to standard output.
